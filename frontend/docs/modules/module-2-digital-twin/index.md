# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Module 2 focuses on creating a comprehensive digital twin for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity. This module bridges the gap between the foundational ROS 2 concepts from Module 1 and the advanced perception systems in Module 3, providing the simulation environment necessary for developing and testing humanoid robot capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Create and validate a complete digital twin using Gazebo and Unity
- Import humanoid URDF models and validate physics behavior
- Simulate realistic sensors (LiDAR, RGB-D, IMU) in digital environments
- Build high-fidelity scenes for humanoid interaction
- Integrate with ROS 2 for seamless simulation-to-reality transfer

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

### Chapter 1: Foundations of Digital Twin Simulation
- Digital twin architecture for humanoid robotics
- Gazebo setup and humanoid import procedures
- Physics fundamentals and simulation parameters
- Validation and testing methodologies

### Chapter 2: Sensor Simulation for Perception
- LiDAR simulation with realistic noise models
- RGB-D and stereo depth camera simulation
- IMU simulation with bias and drift characteristics
- Validation and testing of sensor data fidelity

### Chapter 3: Unity for High-Fidelity Humanoid Interaction
- Importing humanoid models into Unity environment
- Scene building and lighting for realistic perception
- Human-robot interaction simulation scenarios
- Data recording and export for advanced workflows

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics simulation concepts
- Familiarity with 3D modeling and coordinate systems
- Understanding of sensor principles from robotics

## Integration with Other Modules

This module serves as a crucial bridge in the overall curriculum:

- **Module 1 Connection**: Uses URDF models created in ROS 2
- **Module 3 Preparation**: Provides simulation environment for Isaac Sim
- **Module 4 Foundation**: Creates scenarios for VLA system testing

## Technical Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 or WSL2 environment
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- Gazebo Garden or Harmonic
- Unity 2021.3 LTS or later
- NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (recommended)

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to establish the foundational concepts of digital twin simulation, then progress through each chapter to build increasingly sophisticated simulation capabilities for humanoid robots.
